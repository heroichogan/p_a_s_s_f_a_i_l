# Market Entry Pricing

It's easier to make smartphones than to make money on smartphones. That's one way to think about Apple's dominance in the industry--the company takes 92% of all profit, beating out nearly 1,000 competitors. What can explain their success?

## Pricing Smartphones

Every business that is entering an industry must decide how much to charge for its products. A firm that simply marks up the cost of its product won't get far, because customers care not about what it cost you, but about what it will cost them, relative to their perception of its worth.

For high tech products, firms often employ price skimming or market penetration pricing. With a price skimming strategy, the firm introduces an innovative product at a high price point to attract premium customers, those who will pay a high margin. When it has exhausted these customers, the firm lowers its price a bit to attract the next layer of customers, those who will pay nearly as much as the premium customers. Rinse and repeat. The strategy ensures that customers pay something approximating their reservation price, the maximum they would be willing to spend on the new product. 

With a penetration pricing strategy, the firm instead prices low to build its market share. It earns less per sale on a higher sales volume.

Which strategy a company chooses depends on several factors, but the most important is the marketing objective: is the company trying to grow short-term profits, or is it trying to grow the size of its customer base? 

When Apple created the modern smartphone market in 2007, it priced its iPhone as a premium product. Rightly so. At the time, consumers almost exclusively used feature phones. Apple leapfrogged its competition by introducing a product with a large touch screen and easily downloadable apps. This allowed it to occupy a premium position in the market, with the intention of skimming those customers most willing and able to pay for such an offering. 

A year later, phones based on Google's Android operating system entered the market. These phones were priced as a less expensive alternative to the iPhone. Google's penetration strategy was to license Android to many different manufacturers so that it could capture a large share of the market.

## Who Can Make This Work
A firm's ability to execute one of these strategies depends on two major factors: the market's price elasticity, and the differentiability of the product on offer.

Price elasticity--the market's sensitivity to price changes--is more representative of value shoppers; premium shoppers are less responsive to price changes in either direction. But selling at a low price position requires the firm to be a cost leader in the industry.

Differentiability--a product's ability to command a price premium--lets firms earn an ample margin but is something that only certain brands, and certain products, can pull off. 

Apple has succeeded in positioning its iPhone as a premium product. This has allowed it to charge a premium price every year since the phone's introduction.

In contrast, Android's decision to pursue market penetration has driven prices way down. The large number of Android competitors (many of the 1,000 smartphone vendors) has led to excessive price pressure. Sales promotions, discount vendors, TracFones, even a Pepsi branded phone in China have presented top quality brands like Samsung with a commoditization problem that Apple has so far avoided. Just look at the price history:

But both price skimming and penetration pricing are long-term strategies, so some Android vendors like Google and Samsung have motives other than direct profit from device sales. Google wants to drive mobile phone users to its various services. And Samsung sells many of the processors and touchscreens that competitors use in their own phones, so sales directly benefit them (sales also helps them to achieve economies of scale and learning curve effects).

## Wrap-Up
Both price skimming and penetration pricing have been used successfully by countless firms. But the first rule of business is to make a profit. And by this measure, Apple is crushing its competition. Interestingly, the same approach also works for them in the PC industry, where they take 50% of profits.
