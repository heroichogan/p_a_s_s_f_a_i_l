# Writing Smarter Business Plans

Writing a business plan is a love-hate endeavor. The would-be entrepreneur takes an exciting idea, then proceeds to suck the life out of it in a long, dry document that every business professor will tell you: nobody reads. 

There are parts of the process that are worthwhile. The research, which can take a year or more, certainly is; the discussions with collaborators and potential investors, too--people really challenge your idea when their money is on the line. 

But the document itself is largely a relic. It's written like some kind of masterpiece, but despite printing it on the best paper Kinko's has to offer, it's anything but. Indeed, it is the opposite, not a masterpiece but a first draft due for many revisions. 

That's where the elegant The Business Model Canvas comes in. 
Devised by author Alexander Osterwalder and popularized in *Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers* by Alexander Osterwalder, the method uses a one page, graphical layout that has nothing to do with writing tomes.

The idea is to list the nine critical building blocks of any business in a standard form. The specific arrangement of the blocks makes it easier to see how they interact.

The blocks are:
- Value Propositions -- What you're offering your customers.
- Customer Segments -- The relevant categories of customers.
- Channels -- The touch points that let you access your customers.
- Customer Relationships -- The kind of relationships you want to have with your customers.
- Revenue Streams -- The specific things people will be paying you for.
- Key Resources -- The critical resources you need.
- Key Activities -- The crucial things you must be able to do well.
- Key Partners -- Your essential business allies (for activities and resources that you don't do in house).
- Cost Structure -- What all this costs.

Groups of blocks relate to each other in important ways:
- Value Propositions, through Channels, reach Customer Segments which together create the desired Customer Relationship. 
- Key Activities and Key Resources are provided in-house or by Key Partners.
- Revenue Streams and Cost Structure enumerate a high level view of finances.

At first, the canvas seems like just one more prescription for developing a successful business (there are many others). But Osterwalder's book shows it in action, applying it to a variety of intriguing case studies. This is where the canvas really shines.

With the book, you can clearly see how subtle or complex strategies work. For instance, on your own it's a little murky to see how Nintendo's Wii strategy could have differed so much from the competing XBox and PlayStation strategies--the latter two sold their consoles at a loss and earned money elsewhere. Or how anyone could make money with a freemium strategy. The general strategy canvases shown in the middle section of the book make these ideas clear.

But the real fun comes when you apply the canvas and the book's strategies to your own ideas.

Having written several business plans, I decided to try the canvas out on some ideas that I might want to develop. I found the process enjoyable and thought provoking. And it was easy, or more precisely, I wasted no effort on cumbersome, tedious, or low-value tasks. All my effort was directed at generating relevant, credible plans.

The building block format served as a checklist, ensuring that I did not forget about important parts of my plan.

Because the canvas template follows a standard, concise form, it's very easy to compare two canvases. For instance, if you are attempting to describe a freemium strategy of your own, you can compare your canvas to those listed in the book, including a generic canvas for that strategic pattern. You might also find yourself comparing different versions of a plan like you'd compare two drafts of a paper. 

So where does the Business Model Canvas fit in? Certainly, it's something to use in your own work. It should also be a part of every business plan course in the nation, probably as a prelude to writing the fossilized paperweight that most investors expect to receive. I don't know that I would include it in a funding request, though the rising popularity of interest in the canvas (as researched on Google Trends, trends.google.com) may soon invalidate that advice. Since most  investors (and many professors, friends, and advisers) will only read the abstract and the financials, the canvas could become a much needed third leg to that table. 

Ultimately, though, the Business Model Canvas is valuable because it frees you to be wrong at first. Its simplicity and brevity encourage revision, which is something no one wants to do with a conventional plan.
