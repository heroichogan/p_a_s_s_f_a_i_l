# 80/20 versus long-tail strategies

20% of the population owns 80% of the land. 

This odd imbalance was noted not by the Occupy movement of 2011, but by Italian economist Vilfrado Pareto one hundred years earlier. He became fascinated by the imbalance and found that this pattern could be seen all around him. 

Today the idea has traction, partly because we have ready access to the relevant data. Those who look can find that:
- 20% of a pub's patrons drink 80% of the beer
- 20% of all books on Amazon comprise 80% of their sales
- A person wears 20% of their wardrobe 80% of the time
- 20% of their carpets receive 80% of the wear
- 20% of their car's energy propels the vehicle; 80% is lost as heat

We call the phenomenon the 80-20 principle, or the Pareto principle. 

In a nutshell:
>"The Pareto principle is a prediction that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes." [cite]

The rule leads to powerful advice: if 80% of problems or benefits come from a small minority of causes, we should focus our attention on these. 

They are the "vital few" causes, lost in a sea of the "trivial many." 

They are the "hits" in a sea of "misses."

By putting our time, money, or effort into the a few critical, high leverage causes, we can effect great results, be they influence, profit, happiness, or anything else that we value.

## Not So Fast
But the trivial many may be more important than it seems.
Demand curves are a classic Paretto distribution: the 20% "head" of the curve (the leftmost fifth) accounts for 80% of demand.

This pattern affects commerce extensively. For example, because a traditional brick-and-mortar store cannot stock every product, it includes only the most popular, the 20%, the vital few. But today, the internet allows firms to tap into the varied, eclectic demand to the right of the curve--the 80%, the trivial many.  And something interesting happens when consumers have ready access to the less popular items: they buy them. 

For instance, though 13,000 films are shown in festivals each year, the carrying capacity of the U.S. market is only 100 films a year. In the past, most of the others would be forgotten, but today consumers can easily view them on the Internet or through Netflix. 

## An Integrated Perspective
So which is the true view of reality? Both. They are two sides of the same coin. Let's see if we can integrate them into cohesive advice.

- 20% of causes produce 80% of effects.
- The 20% of causes are the vital few. Pay more attention to these.
- But when thinking specifically of a demand curve, also consider the 80%--give buyers access to the majority of products that are not part of the vital few. Allow them to buy hits or niches.
- If the marginal cost of offering each additional product is negligible, then that product should be profitable if it sells at all.
- Just make sure that it's easy for shoppers to wade through the large number of offerings available. This is done via search tools and recommendation engines, as seen on Amazon and many other sites.
